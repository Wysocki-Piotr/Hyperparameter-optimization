# Machine Learning Hyperparameter Tunability Project

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the **tunability of hyperparameters** for three selected machine learning algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Elastic Net) across at least **four datasets**. The project focuses on exploring how different hyperparameter sampling techniques affect model performance and identifying new default hyperparameter configurations that achieve the best average results across datasets.
